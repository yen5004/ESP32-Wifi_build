Excellent! Let‚Äôs add the blinking LED next.

Most ESP32 DevKit boards include a small **onboard LED** tied to **GPIO 2** (sometimes labeled ‚ÄúIO2‚Äù or ‚ÄúLED‚Äù). We‚Äôll write a sketch to blink it once per second.

---

## Blinking LED + Serial Output

```cpp
// ESP32 Hello World + Blink

#define LED_PIN 2   // onboard LED on most ESP32 DevKit boards

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(115200);
  delay(2000);
  Serial.println("Hello, world from ESP32 with blinking LED!");

  pinMode(LED_PIN, OUTPUT);
}

void loop() {
  // Turn LED on
  digitalWrite(LED_PIN, HIGH);
  Serial.println("LED ON");
  delay(1000);

  // Turn LED off
  digitalWrite(LED_PIN, LOW);
  Serial.println("LED OFF");
  delay(1000);
}
```

### What you should see

* Serial Monitor:

  ```
  Hello, world from ESP32 with blinking LED!
  LED ON
  LED OFF
  LED ON
  ...
  ```
* The tiny onboard LED should blink **on/off every second**.

---

‚úÖ If the LED doesn‚Äôt blink:

* Some ESP32 boards use **GPIO 2**, others **GPIO 5**, or **GPIO 22**.
* If nothing lights up, just change `#define LED_PIN 2` to another candidate and re-upload.
* Or check your board‚Äôs seller page/manual for the onboard LED pin number.

the prompt:
can we make it blink twice per second?

Perfect üëå you got it. Right now, the LED is blinking once per second because we have a `delay(1000)` for ON and another `delay(1000)` for OFF ‚Äî that‚Äôs a full 2-second cycle.

If you want it to blink **twice per second** (so ON‚ÄìOFF‚ÄìON‚ÄìOFF within 1 second), each half of the cycle needs to be **250 ms** instead of 1000 ms.

---

## Updated Sketch (Blink 2x per Second)

```cpp
// ESP32 Blink twice per second

#define LED_PIN 2   // onboard LED (try 2, 5, or 22 if needed)

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(115200);
  delay(2000);
  Serial.println("ESP32 blinking LED twice per second!");
  pinMode(LED_PIN, OUTPUT);
}

void loop() {
  digitalWrite(LED_PIN, HIGH);
  Serial.println("LED ON");
  delay(250);   // LED on for 0.25 seconds

  digitalWrite(LED_PIN, LOW);
  Serial.println("LED OFF");
  delay(250);   // LED off for 0.25 seconds
}
```

---

### Behavior

* The LED blinks **two times per second** (ON 250 ms, OFF 250 ms).
* Serial Monitor will show `LED ON` / `LED OFF` messages four times per second.

üëâ Do you want me to also show you how to adjust the blink rate dynamically (e.g., change the speed by sending a number from the Serial Monitor), so you can experiment without editing/re-uploading the sketch every time?

----
Would you like me to also show you how to extend this so you can **control the LED over Serial commands** (e.g., type ‚Äúon‚Äù or ‚Äúoff‚Äù in Serial Monitor to control it)? That‚Äôs often a nice next step.
