ESP32 Development Board TYPE-C USB CH340C WiFi+Bluetooth Ultra-Low Power Consumption Dual Core ESP32-DevKitC-32 ESP-WROOM
USB driver chip: CH340C, with good system compatibility, higher download speed, and more stability. Support VIN external wide voltage input 5-12V power supply (battery version maximum 5.5V input) Support USB power supply, external 3.3V power supply, and VIN power supply three kinds of power supply Mode development
ESP32 integrates antenna, switches, RF balun, power amplifiers, low noise amplifiers, filters and power management modules.
Package include:3 x Type C Interface ESP32 CH340C 30Pins development board ；3 x ESP32 breakout board（Note： the breakout board can not be adapted for ESP32-WROOM-32E，ESP32-WROOM-32D，ESP32 WROOM-32U and ESP32-S development board）. i want to start out with a simple sketch. an output of "hello world" to the serial monitor, once i have that done i will likely add more features. can you help me in this, walk me through the set of this please

Awesome—great boards to learn on. Let’s get you to a “Hello, world” in the Serial Monitor and make sure uploads work reliably. I’ll assume you’re using the Arduino IDE on Windows (the steps are nearly identical on macOS/Linux).

# 1) One-time setup (Arduino IDE + ESP32 support)

1. **Install Arduino IDE** (latest).
2. **Add ESP32 support (Boards Manager):**

   * Open **Tools → Board → Boards Manager…**
   * Search for **“esp32”** and install **“esp32 by Espressif Systems.”**
3. **USB driver (CH340C):**

   * Many Windows 10/11 PCs already have it. If the board doesn’t appear as a COM port when you plug it in, install the **CH340** driver from the chip vendor (search “WCH CH340 driver”) and reconnect.
   * Use a **data** USB-C cable (some charge-only cables won’t work).

# 2) Plug in the board

* Connect the board via **USB-C**.
* In Arduino IDE go to **Tools → Port** and pick the new **COM** port that appears.
* In **Tools → Board**, choose **ESP32 Dev Module** (or **ESP32 DevKitC** if you see that exact option).

*(Defaults are fine: Flash Mode QIO, Partition “Default”, Upload Speed 921600 or 115200.)*

# 3) Minimal “Hello, world” sketch

Paste this into a new sketch:

```cpp
// ESP32 "Hello, world" to Serial Monitor

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(115200);
  // Give USB time to open (helpful on some systems)
  delay(2000);
  Serial.println();
  Serial.println("Hello, world from ESP32! 🎉");
}

void loop() {
  static uint32_t last = 0;
  if (millis() - last >= 1000) { // once per second
    last = millis();
    Serial.println("Tick");
  }
}
```

# 4) Upload + view output

1. Click **Upload** (right-arrow).
2. Open **Tools → Serial Monitor** and set **baud = 115200**.
3. Press the board’s **EN/RESET** button once if you don’t immediately see output.

You should see:

```
Hello, world from ESP32! 🎉
Tick
Tick
...
```

# 5) If upload fails (common fixes)

* **“Failed to connect to ESP32:…”**

  * Hold the **BOOT (IO0)** button, click **Upload**, and **release BOOT** when you see “Connecting…”.
* **No COM port appears:**

  * Try a different USB-C cable/port; install the **CH340** driver; check **Device Manager → Ports (COM & LPT)**.
* **Garbage characters in monitor:**

  * Make sure the Serial Monitor baud is **115200**.
* **Board resets when opening monitor:**

  * That’s normal (DTR toggling). If annoying, use the Serial Plotter or another terminal with DTR off.

# 6) Power notes for your kit

* USB-C from your PC is perfect while developing.
* The board’s **VIN** can accept **5–12 V** (per your listing), but **3.3 V pin is 3.3 V only**. Don’t feed VIN and USB at the same time unless you know the board’s power-path design. For early experiments, just use USB.

If you want, I can extend this sketch next to: print Wi-Fi MAC, blink an onboard LED, or post “hello” to an HTTP endpoint/ntfy server. What would you like to add first?
