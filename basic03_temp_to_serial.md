Yes 👍 that helps a lot!

Your module is one of the common **DHT22 breakout boards** that already has the **10 kΩ pull-up resistor** built in — so wiring is simple, and you don’t need to add any extra components.

The markings you see:

* **“+” → VCC** (power)
* **“OUT” → Data pin** (goes to your ESP32 GPIO of choice)
* **“–” → Ground**

The **“v182”** is likely just a batch/version mark from the module maker, not important for wiring.

## ✅ Wiring (ESP32 ↔ DHT22 module)

* `+` → **3.3 V** on ESP32 (don’t use 5 V; ESP32 is 3.3 V logic)
* `–` → **GND**
* `OUT` → **GPIO 4** (we’ll keep the sketch set to pin 4)

That’s it — only 3 wires!

## ✅ Code Recap

With wiring confirmed, you can use the same sketch I gave you earlier:

```cpp
#include "DHT.h"

#define DHTPIN 4      // OUT pin → GPIO 4
#define DHTTYPE DHT22 // using DHT22

DHT dht(DHTPIN, DHTTYPE);

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(115200);
  Serial.println(F("DHT22 test with ESP32"));
  dht.begin();
}

void loop() {
  float h = dht.readHumidity();
  float t = dht.readTemperature();
  float f = dht.readTemperature(true);

  if (isnan(h) || isnan(t) || isnan(f)) {
    Serial.println(F("Failed to read from DHT sensor!"));
    delay(2000);
    return;
  }

  Serial.print(F("Humidity: "));
  Serial.print(h);
  Serial.print(F("%  Temperature: "));
  Serial.print(t);
  Serial.print(F(" °C / "));
  Serial.print(f);
  Serial.println(F(" °F"));

  delay(2000);
}
```

📌 Tip: The DHT22 updates only about once every **2 seconds**. If you try to read it faster, it’ll just repeat the last value or give you a failure. That’s why I left a `delay(2000)` in there.

Do you want me to also add a **timestamp** (like a running clock in seconds since boot) to each reading, so you can use the Serial Monitor output as a mini data log?
